Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \\"wayward\\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.","output":"- Continuous prompt fine-tuning is a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning.- Discrete interpretations of continuous prompts may not faithfully represent the tasks they solve.- Observed \\"waywardness\\" occurs when prompts projected to arbitrary text still solve the original task effectively.- Larger models exhibit higher waywardness with a minimal accuracy drop.- The study highlights challenges in interpreting continuous prompts and their implications for future language model development."},{"instruction":"List three ways to improve productivity while working from home.","input":"","output":"1.
